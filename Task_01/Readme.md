# 📊 Excel Sales Performance Dashboard  

This project was developed during my **Data Analytics Internship at Elevvo Pathways**.  
The main objective was to design an **interactive dashboard in Excel** to track and analyze sales performance, using the **Superstore Sales Dataset**.

## 🔎 Project Summary  
The dashboard brings together sales insights in one place, helping to monitor performance and spot trends quickly.  
It allows users to explore the data through **dynamic visuals and slicers**, answering questions like:  

- 💰 Which products contribute the most to revenue?  
- 🛒 How are sales distributed across categories and regions?  
- 📆 What patterns do we see in monthly sales?  
- 👤 Which customer segments perform best?

## ⚙️ Features & Highlights

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** total revenue, profit, quantity sold, top product
